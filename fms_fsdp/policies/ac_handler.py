    Apply selective activation checkpointing.

    Selectivity is defined as a percentage p, which means we apply ac
    on p of the total blocks. p is a floating number in the range of
    [0, 1].

    Some examples:
    p = 0: no ac for all blocks. same as `fsdp_activation_checkpointing=False`
    p = 1: apply ac on every block. i.e. "full ac".
    p = 1/2: [ac, no-ac, ac, no-ac, ...]
    p = 1/3: [no-ac, ac, no-ac,   no-ac, ac, no-ac,   ...]
    p = 2/3: [ac, no-ac, ac,    ac, no-ac, ac,    ...]
    Since blocks are homogeneous, we make ac blocks evenly spaced among
    all blocks.

    Implementation:
    For a given ac ratio p, we should essentially apply ac on every "1/p"
    blocks. The first ac block can be as early as the 0th block, or as
    late as the "1/p"th block, and we pick the middle one: (0.5p)th block.
    Therefore, we are essentially to apply ac on:
    (0.5/p)th block, (1.5/p)th block, (2.5/p)th block, etc., and of course,
    with these values rounding to integers.
    Since ac is applied recursively, we can simply use the following math
    in the code to apply ac on corresponding blocks.
